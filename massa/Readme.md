### Minimum Hardware Requirements
  - 3x CPU; the higher the clock speed the better
  - 4GB of RAM
  - 100GB Disk
  
  
### Tips
   - You will reach maximum points when you run your node at home or in a location where other Massa nodes are not busy.
   - If you are using a shared server (VPS) internet usage may result in selling rolls.

## Automatic Installation with Single Script
You can set up your defund node in minutes using the automated script below.

```
wget -O Massa.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodesxploit/testnet/main/massa/massa.sh && chmod +x massa.sh && ./massa.sh
```

## Post-Installation Steps

Create screen
```
screen -S massa
```


Run Node. Set a password where it says `PASSWORD`.
```
cd massa/massa-node

RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release -- -p PASSWORD |& tee logs.txt
```


Create a new window in Screen.
```
CTRL + A + C 
```


Run the client. Set a password where it says `PASSWORD`.
```
cd massa/massa-client/

cargo run --release -- -p PASSWORD
```
*Logically, we run a node in one window and a client in the other window.*



Go to the window where the client is running and create the wallet. Save the keys given in the output.
```
wallet_generate_secret_key
```


Check wallet, back up wallet address and secret key.
```
wallet_info
```


Paste your wallet address in the testnet-faucet channel on the Massa discord server.
Check your balance. It should be `Final Balance 100`.
```
wallet_info
```


If everything is correct create a roll. edit 'walletaddress'
```
buy_rolls walletaddress 1 0
```


Add your node to the network. In the `secretkey` part, write the secretkey that we just backed up by typing wallet info.
```
node_add_staking_secret_keys secretkey

#sample
#node_add_staking_secret_keys qwoieq123981239asdasd
```


Join the Massa discord server. Click on the üëç emoji in the testnet-rewards-registration channel or write something in the channel.
The bot will send you a private message, and you will get your discord id from this message.

After learning the Discord id, come to the client screen of your node and run the code below.
Edit the 'walletaddress' and 'discordid' sections.

```
node_testnet_rewards_program_ownership_proof walletaddress discordid
```


You will receive a long code in response. copy this code and send it to massa bot who just sent you a private message on discord.
Then send the ip address of your server to the same massa bot.



Check your wallet after a few hours.
```
wallet_info
```

If there is an output like the picture below, you are ready.

### Useful Commands
To exit the screen:
```
ctrl+a+d
```

To enter the screen:
```
screen -r massa
```

To navigate between the node and client windows on the screen:
```
ctrl+a+p

#Alternative ctrl+a+a
```

You disconnected from the server and reconnected. You want to enter the screen, but the screen already shows `Attached`.
In this case you need to `Detached` your server first. For this:
```
screen -d massa
```

Good Luck Bro!!
